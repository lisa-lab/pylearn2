Welcome
=======

Pylearn2 is still undergoing rapid development. Don't expect a clean road without bumps!
If you find a bug please write to pylearn-dev@googlegroups.com.
If you're a Pylearn2 developer and you find a bug, please write a unit test for it so
the bug doesn't come back!


Pylearn2 is a machine learning library. Most of its functionality is built on top of
`Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_. 
This means you can write Pylearn2 plugins (new models, algorithms, etc) using
mathematical expressions, and Theano will optimize and stabilize those expressions for
you, and compile them to a backend of your choice (CPU or GPU).

.. _welcome_vision:

Pylearn2 Vision
===============

* Researchers add features as they need them. We avoid getting bogged down by too
  much top-down planning in advance.
* A machine learning toolbox for easy scientific experimentation.
* All models/algorithms published by the LISA lab should have reference implementations
  in Pylearn2.
* Pylearn2 may wrap other libraries such as scikit-learn when this is practical
* Pylearn2 differs from scikit-learn in that Pylearn2 aims to provide great flexibility
  and make it possible for a researcher to do almost anything, while scikit-learn
  aims to work as a "black box" that can produce good results even if the user does not
  understand the implementation
* Dataset interface for vector, images, video, ...
* Small framework for all what is needed for one normal MLP/RBM/SDA/Convolution experiments.
* Easy reuse of sub-component of Pylearn2.
* Using one sub-component of the library does not force you to use / learn to use all of
  the other sub-components if you choose not to.
* Support cross-platform serialization of learned models.
* Remain approachable enough to be used in the classroom (IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).

.. _install:

Download and installation
=========================

There is no PyPI download yet, so Pylearn2 cannot be installed using e.g. ``pip``.
You must check out the bleeding-edge/development version from GitHub
using:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2.git

To make Pylearn2 available in your Python installation, run the following command in the
top-level ``pylearn2`` directory (which should have been created by the previous command):

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py develop

You may need to use ``sudo`` to invoke this command with administrator privileges.
If you do not have such access (or would rather not add Pylearn2 to the global
`site-packages` for whatever reason), you can install the relevant links inside the
`user site-packages directory <https://docs.python.org/2/install/#alternate-installation-the-user-scheme>`_
by issuing the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py develop --user

This command will also compile the Cython extensions required for e.g.
``pylearn2.train_extensions.window_flip``.

Alternatively, you can make Pylearn2 available by adding the installation directory to your
``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable, but note that changing your ``PYTHONPATH``
alone won't compile the Cython extensions (you will need to make sure the extension ``.so``
files are built and accessible within the source tree, e.g. with
``python setup.py build_ext --inplace``).

.. _data_path:

Data path
---------

For some tutorials and tests you will also need to set your ``PYLEARN2_DATA_PATH`` variable.
On Linux, the best way to do this is to add a line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYLEARN2_DATA_PATH=/data/lisa/data

Note that this is only an example, and if you are not in the LISA lab, you will need to
choose a directory path that is valid on your filesystem. Simply choose a path where
it will be convenient for you to store datasets for use with Pylearn2.


Other methods
-------------

Vagrant (any OS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Pylearn2 in a box <https://github.com/ironchief/pylearn2_vagrant>`_ uses Vagrant to easily create a new VM installed with Pylearn2 and the necessary packages.

1. Download and install Vagrant http://www.vagrantup.com/
2. Download and install Virtual Box and VirtualBox Extension Pack https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Download the Vagrant scripts from `Pylearn2 in a box <https://github.com/ironchief/pylearn2_vagrant>`_
4. Start the VM by running ``vagrant up`` in the directory from step 3

Dependencies
============

* `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_ and its dependencies are required to use
  Pylearn2. Since pylearn2 is under rapid development some of its features might depend on the `bleeding-edge version of Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#bleeding-edge-install-instructions>`_.
* PyYAML is required for most functionality.
* PIL is required for some image-related functionality.
* Some dependencies are optional:
    * Pylearn2 includes code for accessing several standard datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.
      However, if you wish to use one of these datasets, you must download the dataset itself
      manually.
    * The original `Pylearn <http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn/>`_ project is required
      for loading some datasets, such as the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge datasets
    * Some features (SVMs) depend on scikit-learn.

License and Citations
=====================

Pylearn2 is released under the 3-claused BSD license, so it may be used for commercial purposes.
The license does not require anyone to cite Pylearn2, but if you use Pylearn2 in published research
work we encourage you to cite this article:

* Ian J. Goodfellow, David Warde-Farley, Pascal Lamblin, Vincent Dumoulin,
  Mehdi Mirza, Razvan Pascanu, James Bergstra, Frédéric Bastien, and

Pylearn2 is primarily developed by academics, and so citations matter a lot to
us. As an added benefit, you increase Pylearn2's exposure and potential user
(and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all users of Pylearn2. Thanks
in advance!

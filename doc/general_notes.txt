General Notes
============

This is in development.


Pylearn2 Vision
===============


* We build the parts when we need them.
* A machine learning toolbox for easy scientific experimentation
* Pylearn2 should contain all relevent models/algorithms published by the lab.
* Can reuse scikit.learn algo when pertinant
* Published models can support the scikit.learn interface
* Dataset interface for vector, images, video, ...
* Small framework for all what is needed for one normal MLP/RBM/SDA/Convolution experiments.
* Easy reuse of sub-component of Pylearn2.
   * You don't need to invest in the entire stack in order to use parts of it.
* Support cross-platform serialization of learned models.


Detailed Vision
===============

* We build the parts when we need them or shortly before
   * There is NOT a big programming effort for stuff that we are not sure we will use.
      * Don't over-enginer (This killed Pylearn1)
   * We should keep in mind the Vision when coding to don't other futur posibility.

* A machine learning toolbox for easy scientific experimentation
   * This means it is OK to expect a high level of sophistication from our users
   * It also means the framework should not restrict very much what is possible
      * These are very different design goals/a very different target user from say scikit-learn where everything should have a "fit" method that just works out of the box.

* Pylearn2 should contain all relevent  models/algorithms published by the lab.
* Can reuse scikit.learn algo when pertinant
* Published models can support the scikit.learn interface
   * When we have one model working publish it on the scikit.learn related projects
      * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/Related-Projects

* Dataset interface
    * reuse scikit-data interface? compatibility? As much as possible.
    * support many topologies: time series, images, videos ...
    * can be used for convolution, tiled convolution, local receptive fields with no tied weights, Toronto's fovea-approximating techniques, ...

* Small framework to allow doing all what is needed for one
  normal MLP/RBM/SDA/Convolution/stacking layers/online training experiments.

    * Stacking layers, online training, different criteria in different phases.
    * Allow to easily change dataset, hyper-parameter, other
      configurable options...

* Easy reuse of sub-component of Pylearn2. This is useful in the framework
  don't fit some need(this will happen).

     * You don't need to invest in the entire stack in order to use parts of it.

* Support cross-platform serialization of learned models.
   * Allow to submit model to competitions and perform different part of experiment on different cluster easily
   * GPU->CPU CPU->GPU

* Support many views for each object. Make it easy for different
  component play different roles. 

   * For example, generative models and datasets both define probability
     distributions that we should be able to sample from.

* Contain a concise human-readable experiment description language
  that makes it easy for other people to replicate our exact experiments
  with others implementations. This should include hyperparameter and other
  related configuration.  (currently we use yaml for this). 

* Include algorithms and utilities that are factored as being separate
  from the model as much as possible. This includes training algorithms,
  visualization algorithms, model selection algorithms, model composition
  or averaging techniques, etc.


Coding style for ALL labs code: http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn/v2_planning/API_coding_style.html
Docstring convention?!?!?:

Jobdispatch
===========

Script that allow to submit jobs in an standard interface to multiple
cluster that use different scheduler.

Jobman
======

Allow to make a db of all wanted jobs to run and manage there
executions(ensure all ended correctly, ...). It support grid search
and random search out of the box.

There is the Hyperplot project that allow to produce graphs and/or tables
with jobman jobs: https://www.assembla.com/code/hyperplot/mercurial/nodes

Use postgres as a back-end database.

Hyperopt
========

James project that allow to do "smart" hyper-parameter search. It also allow to manage jobs similar to jobman, but use mangodb as a back-end batabase.

It support atomic reservation of jobs.

For distributed optimization there are a few commandline utilities of interest:
* hyperopt-mongo-search controls an optimization experiment
* hyperopt-mongo-worker runs on worker nodes and polls a mongodb for
experiments that need to be run.
* hyperopt-mongo-show wraps a couple of visualization strategies of
running experiments.

There is documentation coming along here:
https://github.com/jaberg/hyperopt/wiki

Fred don't have time to work on a switch from jobman to hyperopt to
manage jobs. You can do try it if you want, but I won't be able to
help much.

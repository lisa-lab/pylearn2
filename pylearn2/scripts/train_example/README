pylearn2 tutorial example: "train_example" by Ian Goodfellow

This directory contains an example of how to train a model using pylearn2.

If you are not working from the LISA lab, you'll need to setup
the dataset yourself. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset from
http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~kriz/cifar.html
and put it in your $PYLEARN2_DATA_PATH directory. 

Once you have the data, there are three steps to do in pylearn2.

First, we create a preprocessed dataset and save it
to the filesystem. Then we train a model on that dataset using
the train.py script. Finally we can inspect the model to see
how the learning experiment went.


Step 1: Create the dataset
----------------------------
From this directory, run

python make_dataset.py

This will take a while.

You should read through make_dataset.py to understand what it is doing.
The file is heavily commented and is basically a small tutorial on
pylearn2 datasets.

As a brief summary, this script will load the CIFAR10 database of
32x32 color images. It will extract 8x8 pixel patches from them,
run a regularized version of contrast normalization and whitening
on them, then save them to cifar10_preprocessed_train.pkl.


Step 2: Train the model
-----------------------
You should have pylearn2/scripts in your PATH enviroment variable.
pylearn2/scripts/train.py should have executable permissions.

From this directory, run

train.py cifar_grbm_smd.yaml

This will also take a while.

You should read the yaml file for more information. It is heavily
commented and is basically a tutorial on yaml files and training
models.

As a high level summary, it will create a file called
cifar_grbm_smd.pkl. This file will contain a gaussian binary
RBM trained using denoising score matching.



Step 3: Inspect the model
-------------------------

pylearn2/scripts/show_weights.py and pylearn2/scripts/plot_monitor.py
should have executable permissions.


From this directory, run

show_weights.py cifar_grbm_smd.pkl

A window containing the filters learned by the RBM will appear.
They should mostly be colorless gabor filters, though some
will be color patches.

Note that the filters are still a bit grainy. This is because
the example script doesn't train for very long. You can modify
cifar_grbm_smd.yaml to train for longer if you would like to
see prettier filters.

Now close that window.

Run

plot_monitor.py cifar_grbm_smd.pkl

This will display a plot of the objective function over time, so you
can see what happened during training.

      "### Review of multilayer perceptrons, and how convolutional networks are similar\n",
      "\n",
      "In multilayer_perceptron.ipynb, we saw how the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a versatile model that can do many things. In this series of tutorials, we think of it as a classification model that learns to map an input vector $x$ to a probability distribution $p(y\\mid x)$ where $y$ is a categorical value with $k$ different values. Using a dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ of $(x, y)$, we can train any such probabilistic model by maximizing the log likelihood,\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ \\sum_{x,y \\in \\mathcal{D} } \\log P(y \\mid x). $$\n",
      "\n",
      "The multilayer perceptron defines $P(y \\mid x)$ to be the composition of several simpler functions. Each function being composed can be thought of as another \"layer\" or \"stage\" of processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "A convolutional network is nothing but a multilayer perceptron where some layers take a very special form, which we will call \"convolutional layers\". These layers are specially designed for processing inputs where the indices of the elements have some topological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we represent a grayscale image as an array $I$ with the array indices corresponding to physical locations in the image, then we know that the element $I_{i,j}$ represents something that is spatially close to the element $I_{i+1,j}$. This is in contrast to a vector representation of an image. If $I$ is a vector, then $I_i$ might not be very close at all to $I_{i+1}$, depending on whether the image was converted to vector form in row-major or column major format and depending on whether $i$ is close to the end of a row or column.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other kinds of data with topological in the indices include time series data, where some series $S$ can be indexed by a time variable $t$. We know that $S_t$ and $S_{t+1}$ come from close together in time. We can also think of the (row, column, time) indices of video data as providing topological information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose $T$ is a function that can translate (move) an input in the space defined by its indices by some amount $x$.\n",
      "In other words,\n",
      "$T(S,x)_i = S_j$ where $j=i-x$ (a MathJax or ipython bug seems to prevent me from putting $i-x$ in a subscript).\n",
      "Convolutional layers are an example of a function $f$ designed with the property $f(T(S,x)) \\approx f(S)$ for small x.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means if a neural network can recognize a handwritten digit in one position, it can recognize it when it is slightly shifted to a nearby position. Being able to recognize shifted versions of previously seen inputs greatly improves the generalization performance of convolutional networks.\n",

      "## pylearn2 Spaces\n",
      "\n",
      "In many places in pylearn2, we would like to be able to process several different kinds of data. In previous tutorials, we've just talked about data that could be preprocessed into a vector representation. Our algorithms all worked on vector spaces. However, it's often useful to format data in other ways. The pylearn2 Space object is used to specify the format for data. The VectorSpace class represents the typical vector formatted data we've used so far. The only thing it needs to encode about the data is its dimensionality, i.e., how many elements the vector has. In this tutorial we will start to explicitly represent images as having 2D structure, so we need to use the Conv2DSpace. The Conv2DSpace object describes how to represent a collection of images as a 4-tensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing the Conv2DSpace object needs to describe is the shape of the space--how big is the image in terms of rows and columns of pixels? Also, the image may have multiple channels. In this example, we use a grayscale input image, so the input only has one channel. Color images require three channels to store the red, green, and blue pixels at each location. We can also think of the output of each convolution layer as living in a Conv2DSpace, where each kernel outputs a different channel. Finally, the Conv2DSpace specifies what each axis of the 4-tensor means. The default is for the first axis to index over different examples, the second axis to index over channels, and the last two to index over rows and columns, respectively. This is the format that theano's 2D convolution code uses, but other libraries exist that use other formats and we often need to convert between them."

      "Setting up a convolutional network in pylearn2 is essentially the same as setting up any other MLP. In the YAML experiment description below, there are really just two things to take note of.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, rather than using \"nvis\" to specify the input that the MLP will take, we use a parameter called \"input_space\". \"nvis\" is actually shorthand; if you pass an integer n to nvis, it will set input_space to VectorSpace(n). Now that we are using a convolutional network, we need the input to be formatted as a collection of images so that the convolution operator will have a 2D space to work on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we make a few layers of the network be \"ConvRectifiedLinear\" layers. Putting some convolutional layers in the network makes those layers invariant to small translations, so the job of the remaining layers is much easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't need to do anything special to make the Softmax layer on top work with these convolutional layers. The MLP class will tell the Softmax class that its input is now coming from a Conv2DSpace. The Softmax layer will then use the Conv2DSpace's convert method to convert the 2D output from the convolutional layer into a batch of vector-valued examples."
